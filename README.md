# SWT Canvas Artist        
This project is inspired by the [Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman) channel of Daniel Shiffman and mimics [Processing](https://processing.org/) using the [SWT](https://www.eclipse.org/swt/) [Canvas and GraphicsContext.](https://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-SWT-graphics/SWT_graphics.html)

## What can it do
The current version can do basic graphics, like drawing lines, text, pixels and ovals.

## Who should use this
People that want to experiment with computer graphics using Eclipse and learn a thing or two about the SWT graphics capabilities.

### Newbies
If you are new to Java and Eclipse, and you want to learn the language and IDE in a different way than the classical "Hello, World!" program.

### Graphics Artists / Game Designers
SWT Canvas contains a "game loop" method ('public void draw()') that gets called 1 to 1000 times per second (depending on the set framerate). 

### Contributors
If you are interested in developing a framework like this, then, by all means, contribute. You can also contribute samples for the samples project.
